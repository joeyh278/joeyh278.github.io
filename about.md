## 📍 Philadelphia, PA

Hi! My name's Joey and I'm a rising senior at Drexel University. I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in human-computer interaction. My interests include web and fullstack development and UI/UX design.

I've studied abroad at Hanyang's International Summer School in Seoul, South Korea and am currently part-timing as a software developer at Susquehanna International Group (SIG). I've also completed six months co-ops at Unisys and Lockheed Martin. See more on my LinkedIn in [Contact](/contact/).

I enjoy collecting figures, watching movies, and playing games!
