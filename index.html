	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
		Hey there! My name's Joey Huang and I'm currently a pre-junior at Drexel University 
		in Philadelphia! I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in human-computer interaction.
		I just wrapped up my second co-op at Lockheed Martin and I will be studying abroad at
		Hanyang University this summer! 
	</p>
	<p>
		I've always been fascinated with technology and computers but currently my focus is
		in front end development and specifically UI/UX design. I find that even though it
		is more subjective, there's a lot of freedom to what you can you and you're allowed to be 
		creative. However, you also have to take into consideration who might be using the application
		or what's the best way to display information. You can also visibly see the changes
		which allows users to interact with it directly and provide feedback!
	</p>  	
	<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
	<p>
		On my spare time I enjoy playing video games, reading books, watching movies, and 
		listening to music! I've also picked up learning the piano last year and have been
		trying to continue with that.

	<p>
		Here are some of my favorites:
		<ul>
			<li>Book: The Martian by Andy Weir</li>
			<li>Games: Valorant, Apex Legends, CSGO, and mostly anything multiplayer!</li>
			<li>Music: Pop since it always gives me a burst of energy!</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
